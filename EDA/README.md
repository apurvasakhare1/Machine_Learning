🌸 Iris Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the famous Iris dataset, which is widely used for learning and 
practicing Machine Learning concepts. The purpose of this project is to understand the dataset structure, analyze feature relationships, 
visualize data distributions, and prepare the dataset for machine learning modeling.

📊 Dataset Information

The Iris dataset consists of : 150 samples
4 numerical features:
   1. Sepal Length
   2. Sepal Width
   3. Petal Length
   4. Petal Width

3 target classes:
   1. Setosa
   2. Versicolor
   3. Virginica

Each class contains 50 samples (balanced dataset)

🔍 Key Observations
The dataset contains no missing values.
Data is perfectly balanced across all three species.
Petal length and petal width show strong positive correlation.
Setosa is clearly separable from the other species.
Some overlap exists between Versicolor and Virginica.
Petal features are more significant for classification than sepal features.

🚀 Why This EDA is Important

Exploratory Data Analysis helps in understanding the underlying patterns of the dataset before applying Machine Learning models. 
It ensures better feature selection, improves model performance, and reduces unexpected errors during training.
